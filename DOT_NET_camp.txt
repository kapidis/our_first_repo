JP needs all attendees to be ready to go Monday morning. 

I strongly recommend remoting into  your desktops or bringing your laptops to the course. You don’t have a proper .NET development machine then you should not be taking this course. Those of you that had to give up your .NET dev machines for a unix box can borrow a laptop from me. 

The following must be done before the course:
•	Sign up for a free account on github.com : https://github.com/signup/free
•	Install and configure git on windows so they can read and write using their github account. This video will help:
o	http://vimeo.com/18981346  
•	Visual Studio 2010 Professional (or higher), I use the pro edition

We will need to be able to have ssh access to github.com so that authentication can occur correctly, could you make sure we are not going to run into firewall issues?

The following list is recommended (but not required) software that they could also install:
•	ReSharper 6 or 5.1
•	TestDriven .Net
•	AutoHotKey
